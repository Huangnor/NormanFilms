<p>The best weddings I've been to have usually been the most simple. Keeping the guests to close family and friends, forgeting the elaborate centre pieces and flowers, designer dress and cake, Nicole & Jeremy kept it simple because they knew that they'd not notice these fancy details on their day. I'd like to think their most cherished memory would have been holding hands, grinning like maniacs at each other when taking their vows. Hopefully this video captured some of that essense.
