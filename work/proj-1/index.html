<p> Having the privilege of witnessing Ted & Jeannette carry out their love to one another and share that with family & friends was a wonderful moment to be apart of.
    Instead of a strict timeline to follow and stressing over details, they went at their own pace.
    Despite garnering public attention during our photoshoot, they were still able to show vulnerability in the company of the person that they loved.
    As of 01/05/2021, Ted & Jeannette tied the knot in the church (Toronto Chinese Baptist Church) they called home.

<p>Ted proposed to Jeannette from the comfort of David Troungâ€™s estate in Toronto, Ontario. Keeping it low-key and unassuming, capturing the event was a cooperative effort among family &amp; friends as 12/28/19 marked a step foward into a new chapter of their lives.</p>
